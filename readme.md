# Thala Calculator

## Overview
**Thala Calculator** is a hilarious yet technical project that accepts a string entered by the user and checks whether it’s relatable to the viral **Thala for a Reason** meme or not. The string undergoes multiple checks through `if` and `elif` conditions to determine its connection to the meme. It’s a fun and light-hearted way of combining humor with Python programming!

## Features
- Accepts user input in the form of a string.
- Goes through multiple checks (if-elif conditions) to see if the input is relatable to the **Thala for a Reason** meme.
- Returns whether the string is "Thala" enough or not!

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to input a string.
2. It checks whether the string matches various criteria that are relevant to the **Thala** meme.
3. Based on the input, the program will respond humorously, whether it’s "Thala" enough or not.


## Skills Used
- **Python Programming**: The project demonstrates a fun use of Python with control flow (if-elif conditions).
- **String Manipulation**: Manipulating and checking the string inputs.
- **Basic User Interaction**: Getting input from users and providing output.
